Given the row number n. Print the n-th row of Pascal’s triangle.

Our first observation regarding Pascal’s triangle should be that the n-th row of the triangle has exactly n elements. With this observation, we will proceed to solve this problem.

Naive Approach
In this approach, for every column from 1 to n, we will calculate the element (n, c)(where n is the given row number and c is the column number that will vary from 1 to n) using the previous method. Thus, we will print the row.  


Algorithm / Intuition
In this approach, for every column from 1 to n, we will calculate the element (n, c)(where n is the given row number and c is the column number that will vary from 1 to n) using the previous method. Thus, we will print the row.  

Approach:
The steps are as follows:

We will use a loop(say c) to iterate over each column i.e. from 1 to n. And for each column, we will do the following steps:
First, we will consider n-1 as n and c-1 as r.
After that, we will simply calculate the value of the combination using a loop. 
The loop will run from 0 to r. And in each iteration, we will multiply (n-i) with the result and divide the result by (i+1).
Finally, we will print the element.
Finally, the entire row will be printed.
