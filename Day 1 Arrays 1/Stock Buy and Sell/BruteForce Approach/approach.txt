Algorithm / Intuition
Intuition: We can simply use 2 loops and track every transaction and maintain a variable maxPro to contain the max value among all transactions.

Approach: 

Use a for loop of ‘i’ from 0 to n.
Use another for loop of j from ‘i+1’ to n.
If arr[j] > arr[i] , take the difference and compare  and store it in the maxPro variable.
Return maxPro.
