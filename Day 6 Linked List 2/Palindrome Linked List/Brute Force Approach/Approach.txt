Solution: Using the extra data structure

Approach:

We can store elements in an array. Then check if the given array is a palindrome. How to check if an array is a palindrome? 

Let’s take a string, say “level” which is a palindrome. Let’s observe a thing.


So we can see that each index letter is the same as (length-each index -1) letter. 

The same logic required to check an array is a palindrome.

Following are the steps to this approach.

Iterate through the given list to store it in an array.
Iterate through the array.
For each index in range of n/2 where n is the size of the array
Check if the number in it is the same as the number in the n-index-1 of the array.
