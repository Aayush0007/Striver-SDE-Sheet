Solution: Hashing

Approach:

We need to keep track of all the nodes we have visited till now so that once we visit the same node again we can say that a cycle is detected. The process is as follows:

Use a hash table for storing nodes. 
Start iterating through the lists.
If the current node is present in the hash table already, this indicates the cycle is present in the linked list and returns true.
Else move insert the node in the hash table and move ahead.
If we reach the end of the list, which is NULL, then we can say that the given list does not have a cycle in it and hence we return false.
