Solution 3: Difference in length

Approach:

We will reduce the search length. This can be done by searching the length of the shorter linked list. How? Letâ€™s see the process.

Find the length of both lists.
Find the positive difference between these lengths.
Move the dummy pointer of the larger list by the difference achieved. This makes our search length reduced to a smaller list length.
Move both pointers, each pointing two lists, ahead simultaneously if both do not collide.
