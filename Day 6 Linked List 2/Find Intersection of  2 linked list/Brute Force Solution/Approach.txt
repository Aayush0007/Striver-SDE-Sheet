Solution 1: Brute-Force

Approach: We know intersection means a common attribute present between two entities. Here, we have linked lists as given entities. 

What should be the common attribute for two linked lists? 

If you believe a common attribute is a node’s value, then think properly! If we take our example 1, there we can see both lists have nodes of value 3. But it is not the first intersection node. So what’s the common attribute?

It is the node itself that is the common attribute. So, the process is as follows:-

Keep any one of the list to check its node present in the other list. Here, we are choosing the second list for this task.
Iterate through the other list. Here, it is the first one. 
Check if the both nodes are the same. If yes, we got our first intersection node.
If not, continue iteration.
If we did not find an intersection node and completed the entire iteration of the second list, then there is no intersection between the provided lists. Hence, return null.
