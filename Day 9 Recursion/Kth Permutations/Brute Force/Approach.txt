Solution 1: Brute Force Solution

Approach:  

The extreme naive solution is to generate all the possible permutations of the given sequence.  This is achieved using recursion and every permutation generated is stored in some other data structure (here we have used a vector). Finally, we sort the data structure in which we have stored all the sequences and return the Kth sequence from it.
