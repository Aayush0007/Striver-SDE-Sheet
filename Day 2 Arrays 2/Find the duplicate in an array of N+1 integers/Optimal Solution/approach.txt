Approach: Let’s take an example and dry run on it to understand.


Initially, we have 2, then we got to the second index, we have 9, then we go to the 9th index, we have 1, then we go to the 1st index, we again have 5, then we go to the 5th index, we have 3, then we go to the 3rd index, we get 6, then we go to the 6th index, we get 8, then we go to the 8th index, we get 7, then we go to the 7th index and we get 9 and here cycle is formed.


Now initially, the slow and fast pointer is at the start, the slow pointer moves by one step, and the fast pointer moves by 2 steps.








The slow and fast pointers meet at 7. Now take the fast pointer and place it at the first element i.e 2 and move the fast and slow pointer both by 1 step. The point where they collide will be the duplicate number.



So 9 is the duplicate number.

Intuition: Since there is a duplicate number, we can always say that cycle will be formed.

The slow pointer moves by one step and the fast pointer moves by 2 steps and there exists a cycle so the first collision is bound to happen.


Let’s assume the distance between the first element and the first collision is a. So slow pointer has traveled a distance while fast(since moving 2 steps at a time) has traveled 2a distance. For slow and a fast pointer to collide 2a-a=a should be multiple of the length of cycle, Now we place a fast pointer to start. Assume the distance between the start and duplicate to be x. So now the distance between slow and duplicate shows also be x, as seen from the diagram, and so now fast and slow pointer both should move by one step.
