Solution 2: 

Intuition: This is the optimization of the issafe function. In the previous issafe function, we need o(N) for a row, o(N) for the column, and o(N) for the diagonal. Here, we will use hashing to maintain a list to check whether that position can be the right one or not.

Approach: 

For checking Left row elements


For checking upper diagonal and lower diagonal
