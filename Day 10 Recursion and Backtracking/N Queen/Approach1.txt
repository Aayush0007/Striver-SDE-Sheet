Solution 1: 

Intuition: Using the concept of Backtracking, we will place Queen at different positions of the chessboard and find the right arrangement where all the n queens can be placed on the n*n grid.


Approach:

Ist position: This is the position where we can see no possible arrangement is found where all queens can be placed since, at the 3rd column, the Queen will be killed at all possible positions of row.


2nd position: One of the correct possible arrangements is found. So we will store it as our answer.



3rd position: One of the correct possible arrangements is found. So we will store it as our answer.



4th position: This is the position where we can see no possible arrangement is found where all queens can be placed since, at the 4th column, the Queen will be killed at all possible positions of row.
