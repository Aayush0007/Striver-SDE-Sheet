Solution:
Observation: How many integers can occur more than floor(N/3) times in the given array:

If we closely observe, in the given array, there can be a maximum of two integers that can occur more than floor(N/3) times. Letâ€™s understand it using the following scenario:
Assume there are 8 elements in the given array. Now, if there is any majority element, it should occur more than floor(8/3) = 2 times. So, the majority of elements should occur at least 3 times. Now, if we imagine there are 3 majority elements, then the total occurrence of them will be 3X3 = 9 i.e. greater than the size of the array. But this should not happen. That is why there can be a maximum of 2 majority elements.

Naive Approach (Brute-force): 
We will run a loop that will select the elements of the array one by one.
Now, for each unique element, we will run another loop and count its occurrence in the given array.
If any element occurs more than the floor of (N/3), we will include it in our answer. 
While traversing if we find any element that is already included in our answer, we will just skip it.
