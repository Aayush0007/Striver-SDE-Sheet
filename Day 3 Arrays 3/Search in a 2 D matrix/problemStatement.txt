Search in a sorted 2D matrix
Problem Statement: Given an m*n 2D matrix and an integer, write a program to find if the given integer exists in the matrix.

Given matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row
Example 1:

Input: matrix = 
[[1,3,5,7],
 [10,11,16,20],
 [23,30,34,60]], 

target = 3

Output: true

Explanation: As the given integer(target) exists in the given 2D matrix, the function has returned true.
