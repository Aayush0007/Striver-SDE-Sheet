Solution 2: Using Binary Exponentiation

Approach: Initialize ans as 1.0  and store a duplicate copy of n i.e nn using to avoid overflow

Check if nn is a negative number, in that case, make it a positive number.

Keep on iterating until nn is greater than zero, now if nn is an odd power then multiply x with ans ans reduce nn by 1. Else multiply x with itself and divide nn by two.

Now after the entire binary exponentiation is complete and nn becomes zero, check if n is a negative value we know the answer will be 1 by and.
