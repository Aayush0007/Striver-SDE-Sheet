Solution 2: Optimized
Approach:
The optimisation will be in removing the extra spaces, i.e, the hashmap used in brute force. This approach can be broken down into three steps. 

Create deep nodes of all nodes. Instead of storing these nodes in a hashmap, we will point it to the next of the original nodes.
Take a pointer, say itr, point it to the head of the list. This will help us to point random pointers as per the original list. This can be achieved by itr->next->random = itr->random->next
Use three pointers. One dummy node whose next node points to the first deep node. itr pointer at the head of the original list and fast which is two steps ahead of the itr. This will be used to separate the original linked list with the deep nodes list.
