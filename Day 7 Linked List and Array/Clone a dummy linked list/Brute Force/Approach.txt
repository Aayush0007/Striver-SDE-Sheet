Solution 1: Brute Force
Approach:
We will use a hash-map for keeping track of deep copies of every node.

Iterate through the entire list.
For each node, create a deep copy of each node and hash it with it. Store it in the hashmap.
Now, again iterate through the given list. For each node, link the deep node present as the hash value of the original node as per original node. 
the head of the deep copy list will be the head of hashed value of original node.
