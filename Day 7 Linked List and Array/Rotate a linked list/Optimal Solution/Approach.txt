Solution: Optimal Solution

Approach:

Letâ€™s take an example. 

head = [1,2,3,4,5] k = 2000000000

If we see a brute force approach, it will take O(5*2000000000) which is not a good time complexity when we can optimize it.

We can see that for every k which is multiple of the length of the list, we get back the original list. Try to operate brute force on any linked list for k as a multiple of the length of the list.

This gives us a hint that for k greater than the length of the list, we have to rotate the list for k%length of the list. This reduces our time complexity.

Steps to the algorithm:-

Calculate the length of the list.
Connect the last node to the first node, converting it to a circular linked list.
Iterate to cut the link of the last node and start a node of k%length of the list rotated list.
