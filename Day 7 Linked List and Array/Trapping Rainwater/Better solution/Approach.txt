Solution 2:Better solution

Intuition: We are taking O(N) for computing leftMax and rightMax at each index. The complexity can be boiled down to O(1) if we precompute the leftMax and rightMax at each index.

Approach: Take 2 array prefix and suffix array and precompute the leftMax and rightMax for each index beforehand. Then use the formula min(prefix[I], suffix[i])-arr[i] to compute water trapped at each index.
