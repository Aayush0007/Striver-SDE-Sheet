Length of the longest subarray with zero Sum
Problem Statement: Given an array containing both positive and negative integers, we have to find the length of the longest subarray with the sum of all elements equal to zero.

Examples
Example 1:
Input Format: N = 6, array[] = {9, -3, 3, -1, 6, -5}
Result: 5
Explanation: The following subarrays sum to zero:
{-3, 3} , {-1, 6, -5}, {-3, 3, -1, 6, -5}
Since we require the length of the longest subarray, our answer is 5!
