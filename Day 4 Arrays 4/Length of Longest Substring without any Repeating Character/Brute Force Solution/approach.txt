Solution 1: Brute force Approach

Approach: This approach consists of taking the two loops one for traversing the string and another loop â€“ nested loop for finding different substrings and after that, we will check for all substrings one by one and check for each and every element if the element is not found then we will store that element in HashSet otherwise we will break from the loop and count it.
