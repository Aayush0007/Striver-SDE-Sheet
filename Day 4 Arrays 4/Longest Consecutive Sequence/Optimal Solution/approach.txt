Solution 2: (Optimal Approach)
Approach:
We will first push all elements in the HashSet. Then we will run a for loop and check for any number(x) if it is the starting number of the consecutive sequence by checking if the HashSet contains (x-1) or not. If ‘x’ is the starting number of the consecutive sequence we will keep searching for the numbers y = x+1, x+2, x+3, ….. And stop at the first ‘y’ which is not present in the HashSet. Using this we can calculate the length of the longest consecutive subsequence.
