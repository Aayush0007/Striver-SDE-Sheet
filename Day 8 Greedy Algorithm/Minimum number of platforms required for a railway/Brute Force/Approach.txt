Solution 1: Naive Approach 

Intuition: Take each interval of arrival and departure one by one and count the number of overlapping time intervals. This can easily be done using nested for-loops. Maintain the maximum value of the count during the process and return the maximum value at the end.

Approach: We need to run two nested for-loops. Inside the inner loop count the number of intervals which intersect with the interval represented by the outer loop. As soon as the inner loop ends just update the maximum value of count and proceed with the next iteration of the outer loop. After the process ends we will get the maximum value of the count.
